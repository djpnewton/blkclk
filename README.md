# blkclk

test project for controlling a small screen with ESP32
using the ESP-IDF framework

This project is based on the TTGO T-Display board
https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display

We will eventually try to connect to wifi and show
the current bitcoin blockchain block number on the screen
